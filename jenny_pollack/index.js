// It should also respond to a get request to /greet/name 
// where name is any single word string.
//  It should send back a string that greets that name.

// It should also have a separate post request to /greet 
// that takes the name in JSON format.

// There should be tests using chaiHTTP for both routes, 
// as well as a gulpfile/package.json

// You should have an html page that describes the 
// routes implemented by the api available   

// at the root of the server (for a bonus point 
// 	auto populate the routes list, for another 
// 	bonus point also style the html page)
