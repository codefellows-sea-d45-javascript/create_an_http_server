<h2>this sweet server has 3 proto-routes:</h2>
<h3>a 'get' request that provides the server's current time if you enter a '/timer/' after localhost:3030</h3>
<h3>a 'get' request that functions if you enter a '/greet/' + your name after localhost:3030</h3>
<h3>a 'post' request that functions if you enter a '/greet/' + your name after localhost:3030.  for that one, you'll need to use postman or another tool to enter the request as a post.</h3>
