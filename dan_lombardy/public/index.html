    <h1>Welcom to Dan's HTTP Server Test</h1>
    <p>I have implemented several features. Simply enter the code below to access them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get the server time by running a GET request and appending "/server" to the end of the url</li>
      <li>Post a name to the server to have that name greeted. To do this, simply POST a JSON string
        of the format '{"name": "XXX"}' to the url of "/greet" The example below uses superagent
          and superagent-cli from the command line to post:
      <pre>
      superagent localhost:3000/greet post '{"name": "XXX"}'
      </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Get a greeting of the last name Posted to the server. If ther hasn't been any names
        posted to the server, then the name will default to "john". To see the name that will
        be greeted, run a GET request to "/greet/name".
      </li>
    </ul>
