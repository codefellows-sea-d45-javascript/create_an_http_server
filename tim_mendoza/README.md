Assingment Description
---------------------------
For this assignment you should write an http server in vanilla node that responds to several different routes.

The server should respond to a request to /time that will send back the current time of the server.

  * It should also respond to a get request to /greet/name where name is any single word string. 
  * It should send back a string that greets that name.
  * It should also have a separate post request to /greet that takes the name in JSON format.
  * There should be tests using chaiHTTP for both routes, as well as a gulpfile/package.json
  * You should have an html page that describes the routes implemented by the api available at the root of the server
